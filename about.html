                        <p>
                            Hello! I'm Nasreen (Wild Rose), often going by the name Nas. My journey took me to Oregon State University, where I cultivated a deep love for computer science, earning my Master’s degree along the way. Yet, beyond the binary world, my heart beats for the hidden tales of geography and the enchanting dance of numbers in mathematics—they call to me like a siren’s song.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Imagine a world where creativity intertwines every aspect of life. That’s where I come alive. Visualize the thrill of painting a blank canvas with colors of the heart or the poetic rhythm of piano keys under my fingers. Picture a camera capturing a fleeting moment, whispering tales through each photograph. My passion doesn't stop there—it reaches into the structural realm of architecture and design, where I dream of spaces that breathe life and innovation.             
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every artistic endeavor is like a breath of fresh air for my soul, continually fueling my imagination and shaping my outlook on the world. It's through these creative pursuits that I navigate this beautiful tapestry of existence, offering a unique philosophical lens to view the world around me.
                        </p>
